Supervised Machine Learning

This task uses the Logistic Regression model and the Random Forest Classifier model on loans data from the LendingClub to predict if a loan will be high rist or not. It uses the two models on scaled and unscaled data to evaluate and compare the model scores.

Conclusions
- In the unscaled data, the Random Forest Classifier model performed a little over 50%

- In the scaled data, noticed that with the logistic regretion, it improved to almost 76%.

- The Random forest Classifier on the scaled data, the performance went down to 62%. Compaired to the Random Forest Classifier stay almost the same with a small difference.
